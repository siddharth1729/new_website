Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.<p>Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, <em>Stanley</em> found himself unable to move for the longest time.<p>But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.<p>All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.</div><footer class=footer></footer>
